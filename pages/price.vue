                            <h4><img class="size-full alignleft" src="../assets/about.jpg" width="880" height="570" />This small architectural bureau was founded by two former colleagues and friends, Lesley Prinkle and Reginald Matthews.</h4>
                            <p>At that moment they both worked at the SDK agency, but both of them felt unsatisfied with how the big business does operate and how both the quality and client&#8217;s best interests suffer from that.</p>
                            <p>So they've decided to found some small venture of their own, moving to LA and hoping for the best.</p>
                            <p>Just half a year ago, with the addition of a part-time engineer onboard, the team was finally able to take on even more complex projects!</p>
                            <h4>Keep in mind, that if you'll need any building designed by these guys, it won't be cheap! It will be reasonably cheap!</h4>
